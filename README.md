# calculator
This is my first major project in any coding language, I'm posting it here so that I can track my progress.



This is a simple calculator I made so that I can test my beginner skills. If anyone sees this somehow and thinks I could improve on something, please tell me. This calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, and roots. You can only do one at a time.
